Udemy Clone – Responsive Frontend Implementation
Overview
This project is a fully responsive front-end clone of the Udemy homepage, built using semantic HTML5 and modern CSS3. The goal of this project was to replicate a real-world production layout while applying responsive design principles and scalable CSS architecture.
The project focuses on layout structuring, Flexbox implementation, component organization, and multi-section footer design.

Tech Stack
•	HTML5 (Semantic Structure)
•	CSS3
o	Flexbox
o	Media Queries
o	Responsive Layout Techniques
•	Google Fonts (Inter)
•	Font Awesome Icons
•	Git & GitHub for version control

Key Features
1. Responsive Navigation Bar
•	Multi-section navigation layout
•	Integrated search input
•	Interactive hover dropdown (My Learning)
•	Responsive behavior:
o	Selective content hiding at smaller breakpoints
o	Layout adjustments for tablet and mobile
2. Hero Section
•	Full-width promotional banner
•	Positioned content overlay using position: absolute
•	Responsive fallback (overlay hidden on smaller screens)
3. Course Sections
Two primary sections:
•	Recommended Courses
•	Trending Courses
Each section:
•	Uses Flexbox-based card layout
•	Maintains consistent spacing with gap system
•	Adjusts dynamically using flex-basis
•	Mobile-first responsive resizing
Responsive behavior:
•	Desktop: 5 cards per row
•	Tablet: 4 cards per row
•	Mobile: 2 cards per row
4. Topics Section
•	Flexible tag-based layout
•	Uses flex-wrap and proportional sizing
•	Hidden at smaller screen widths to improve UX
5. Multi-Level Footer Architecture
The footer is divided into four structured sections:
1.	Promotional call-to-action section
2.	Skill categories section
3.	Company & legal navigation section
4.	Bottom utility bar (logo, language, cookies)

Techniques used:
•	Nested Flexbox containers
•	Spacing control using gap
•	Responsive column stacking
•	Column reordering using flex-direction: column-reverse on mobile

Responsive Strategy
Two primary breakpoints:
@media (max-width: 800px)
@media (max-width: 600px)

Adjustments include:
•	Hiding non-essential navigation elements
•	Changing card grid proportions
•	Removing overlay components
•	Stacking footer content vertically
•	Optimizing spacing for small screens

Design & Layout Approach
•	Component-based class naming
•	Consistent spacing system
•	Flexbox-driven layout control
•	Hover states for interactive elements
•	Clean visual hierarchy using font weights and spacing

Challenges Solved
•	Managing Flexbox behavior across multiple screen sizes
•	Preventing layout collapse during responsive adjustments
•	Structuring a complex multi-column footer
•	Implementing hover dropdown using only CSS
•	Maintaining consistent card alignment across sections

Future Improvements
•	Implement mobile hamburger navigation
•	Improve accessibility (ARIA roles, better semantic grouping)
•	Refactor layout to partially use CSS Grid
•	Add JavaScript for enhanced interactivity
•	Improve performance with image optimization
